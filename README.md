# XML to JSON Converter

This Java application allows you to perform various tasks related to XML to JSON conversion. Below are the available tasks and examples of how to use them.

## Tasks:

1. **Convert XML to JSON**: Read an XML file into a JSON object and write the JSON object back on disk as a JSON file.
2. **Extract Sub-Object**: Read an XML file into a JSON object, and extract some smaller sub-object inside, given a certain path (use JSONPointer). Write that smaller object to disk as a JSON file.
3. **Check for Key Path**: Read an XML file into a JSON object, check if it has a certain key path. If so, save the JSON object to disk; if not, discard it.
4. **Add Prefix to Keys**: Read an XML file into a JSON object, and add the prefix "swe262_" to all of its keys.
5. **Replace Sub-Object**: Read an XML file into a JSON object, replace a sub-object on a certain key path with another JSON object that you construct, then write the result on disk as a JSON file. 

## Prerequisites

Before using this application, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

## Usage:

1. Navigate to the project directory (the directory containing pom.xml).
2. Use the following Maven command to execute the desired task:

```shell
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="<task> <XML file path> [JSON Pointer/Replacement JSON]"
```

- `<task>`: The task to perform (task1, task2, task3, task4, task5).
- `<XML file path>`: The path to the input XML file.
- `[JSON Pointer/Replacement JSON]`: Optional, depending on the task.

## Examples:

### Task 1 - Convert XML to JSON:

```shell
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="task1 src/main/resources/sample1.xml"
```

### Task 2 - Extract Sub-Object:

```shell
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="task2 src/main/resources/sample1.xml /company/employees/employee/1"
```

### Task 3 - Check for Key Path:

```shell
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="task3 src/main/resources/sample1.xml /company/employees/employee/1"
```

### Task 4 - Add Prefix to Keys:

```shell
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="task4 src/main/resources/sample1.xml"
```

### Task 5 - Replace Sub-Object:

```shell
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="task5 src/main/resources/sample1.xml /company/employees/employee/1"     
```

Enter the replacement JSON when prompted.

```shell
{"name": "new name", "id": 1,"position": "new position", "department": "new department"}
```

## Output
The output JSON file generated by each task will be located in the target/output directory within the project directory. You can find the output JSON files there after running the respective tasks.

## Note on Large XML Files:

This application is not suitable for processing very large XML files (e.g., GB-scale files). Attempting to process such files may result in performance issues or errors.

Potential Issues
1. **Memory Consumption**: The application reads the entire XML file into memory, which can lead to OutOfMemoryError for large files.
2. **Processing Speed**: The conversion process is linear and can be slow for large files, as it does not utilize parallel processing.
